[Sopa para Todos](https://sopaparatodos.pt/) is a movement with the purpose of helping fight hunger and re-launch the catering business (restaurants, caf√©s, etc.) in Portugal. The movement accomplishes this mission by inviting people to pay for a soup that will be gifted to those that need it.

I was **one of the founding members** of the movement and my role focuses the development of the website and map that contains information on the available businesses, and the upkeep of servers and email infrastructure.
