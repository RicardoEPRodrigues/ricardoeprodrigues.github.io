[Labjogos](https://labjogos.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/) is an academic group that supports the sharing of knowledge and development of games in Técnico Lisboa. I was one of their members and, at one point, the lead coordinator of the group. The group develops several activities throughout the academic year, such as games and gamedev-related workshops, game jams, and talks.

I programmed part of the website and helped guide its development. Both this website and LabJogos' have a dark theme, making it a very interesting experience depending on your OS's theme.
