Labjogos is an academic group that supports the sharing of knowledge and development of games in Técnico Lisboa. I was one of their members and, at one point, lead coordinator of the group. The group develops several activities throughout the academic year, such as games and gamedev related workshops, gamejams, and talks.

I programmed part of the website and helped guide its development. Both this website and LabJogos' have a dark theme, making it a very interesting experience depending on your OS's theme.
