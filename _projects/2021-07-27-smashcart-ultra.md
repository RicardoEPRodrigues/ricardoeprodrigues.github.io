[Smashcart Ultra](https://sopaparatodos.pt/) is a low-poly shopping-cart simulator game where you get the chance to (or at least try to) control a crazy cart. Play a variety of mini-games with your friends and end the game as the true victor.

This project is being developed in the student club [Game Dev TÃ©cnico](https://gamedev.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/), where I was one of the founding members, coordinador, and producer of this game. While I did not program much in this project, I was resposible for managing the team and guide the development. I have since left my role, but the development continues!
