Game Engine [3Engine](https://ricardoeprodrigues.github.io/3Engine/) using OpenGL made for a Masters' class on *Computer Graphics for Games*.

Although developed for a class, I kept developing the software to help me learn how OpenGL works. It also helped me improve my C++ code, although a lot of my code is experimental.
