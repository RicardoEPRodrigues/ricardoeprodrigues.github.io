This past Friday, 14th of July 2022, **I presented my Thesis Proposal**. This step in my Ph.D. is long in the making and marks more than half of the process of a Ph.D. **I had to prepare a document and a presentation**. The former holds a lot of info but also serves as a base for my final thesis. **It covers a diverse set of topics, like emotions, believability, and anticipation.**

You can find the [**Thesis Proposal document** here](<{{ site.url }}/assets/uploads/CAT_Enriching_Simple_Actions_with_Impactful_Emotions.pdf>):

As for the **presentation**, it is supposed to showcase the core of the work done in 20 minutes, not an easy task. I focused on topics I still haven't completely figured out, although a lot of my work is on track to a good solution. If you'd like to see the slides, you can do so here:

<div style="position: relative; width: 100%; height: 0; padding-top: 56.2500%;
 padding-bottom: 48px; box-shadow: 0 2px 8px 0 rgba(63,69,81,0.16); margin-top: 1.6em; margin-bottom: 0.9em; overflow: hidden;
 border-radius: 8px; will-change: transform;">
  <iframe loading="lazy" style="position: absolute; width: 100%; height: 100%; top: 0; left: 0; border: none; padding: 0;margin: 0;"
    src="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.canva.com&#x2F;design&#x2F;DAFFLqw-LfQ&#x2F;view?embed" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" allow="fullscreen">
  </iframe>
</div>

The presentation went well and I was lucky to receive a lot of great feedback. Interesting input to better my message was that of **linking back to the problem and hypothesis when introducing and closing a section**, chapter, or whenever necessary. This feedback while appearing obvious is something easy to forget when you are writing long documents. Furthermore, another noteworthy suggestion was to **include a personal reflection in the summary of a chapter**, thus adding a view on why that chapter mattered and what are the big messages it should pass on.

In closing, **a lot of work went into the production of this document and presentation, yet a lot more is still to come for my Ph.D. Thesis**. Wish me luck!
