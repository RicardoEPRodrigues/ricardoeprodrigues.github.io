This past Friday, 14th of July 2022, I presented my Thesis Proposal. This step in my Ph.D. is long in the making and marks more than half of the process of a Ph.D. I had to prepare a document and a presentation. The former holds a lot of info but also serves as a base for my final thesis. It covers a diverse set of topics, like emotions, believability, and anticipation.

You can find the Thesis Proposal document here:

As for the presentation, it is supposed to showcase the core of the work done in 20 minutes, not an easy task. I focused on topics I still haven't completely figured out, although a lot of my work is on track to a good solution. If you'd like to see the slides, you can do so here:

<div style="position: relative; width: 100%; height: 0; padding-top: 56.2500%;
 padding-bottom: 48px; box-shadow: 0 2px 8px 0 rgba(63,69,81,0.16); margin-top: 1.6em; margin-bottom: 0.9em; overflow: hidden;
 border-radius: 8px; will-change: transform;">
  <iframe loading="lazy" style="position: absolute; width: 100%; height: 100%; top: 0; left: 0; border: none; padding: 0;margin: 0;"
