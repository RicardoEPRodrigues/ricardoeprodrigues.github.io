Perhaps you are interested in making your own website, but you are poor just like me! After looking at the most common choices to make a website, like CMS (e.g. WordPress, Joomla, Drupal) or Website Builders (e.g. Wix, SquareSpace, Weebly), you come to the conclusion that **(1)** you don't want to pay for hosting a web server, **(2)** you don't want to pay for someone to make it. So what can you do?

Regarding a place to put your website, I found [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) a good solution and while there may be other platforms that might offer the same behavior, I use this one. I followed the instructions in the link above and create a public repo name `ricardoeprodrigues.github.io`. I invite you to play around with it and learn the ropes.

Now that we have free and (mostly) easy-to-use hosting, we can focus on building our own page. First off, Github Pages uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), "a simple, blog-aware, static site generator perfect for personal, project, or organization sites", so that's exactly what we'll use (hey it is free, so why not?). Now, being the lazy guy I am, I don't want to build a website from scratch, so I looked into website templates. The internet is an amazing place filled with wonderful (and free!) things, so I ... **\*[yoink](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJq8IxTxkLQ) this*** [Indigo Minimalist Jekyll Template from Sergio](https://github.com/sergiokopplin/indigo), and started hacking.
