It has been a minute, uhm? Well, a lot is happening and I just wanted to keep you updated!

**Why was I missing for so long?** Tons of work! Why am I back now? Well, I still have tons of work, but I have mostly finished the coding for my game and Ph.D. It is a huge step for me and one I was not expecting to reach although I was almost there.

**What comes next?** I will now focus on writing and experimenting, rather than coding. I still have a couple of months to finish everything, but I'm almost there.

I do not know when I will return to blogging more often, but I hope soon. It will all depends on the amount of work and time I have to finish my Ph.D.

*The final stretch!*

This is it for now, but I can leave you with something more substantial. I have published a newer version of **Adfectus** on itch.io. It adds tons of good stuff since my last update, including emoji-like facial expressions, a color outline for emotion expressions, overhead background to signal emotional changes, a new rage emotion expression, and the obligatory bug fixes.

If you are interested in the game and would like to participate in future experiments on it, I invite you to [fill out this form](https://forms.gle/uALkPYyBV3Q99KE48).
