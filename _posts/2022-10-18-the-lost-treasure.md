During my Master's degree, in 2015, I took a course on 3D Programming. Although I do not remember much of the course, the final project was one of the most exciting challenges in the degree.

The students would propose concepts of sensations to be implemented in a real-time cinematic in a game engine. My group (of three students) decided to tackle the feeling of claustrophobia, mystery, and awe. I was responsible for the sensation of mystery. We decided to design a cinematic where the viewer would start at the entrance of a cave, start moving into it, pass through a claustrophobic corridor almost entirely submerged, and then be led to an old temple with a skylight, where they would find and open an old chest filled with treasures.
