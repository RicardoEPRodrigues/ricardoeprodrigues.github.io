My name is Ricardo Rodrigues and I am passionate about games, playing them, and building them.

## Why Color Crow?

It all relates back to a Tattoo I have on my right arm portraying a **colorful crow on top of some books**. The amazing artist behind this drawing is Taylor Catclaw ([@taylorcatclaw](https://www.instagram.com/taylorcatclaw/)).

Why the crow? I can say that it represents knowledge, the link to the inevitable death of everything, and the pain associated with it, furthermore, it is also part of the symbol of the city I was born in, Lisbon, and it is symbolically linked to tales of the unknown from authors like H.P. Lovecraft and Edgar Allan Poe (hence the books), but at the end of the day I like the animal and the tattoo is amazing!
