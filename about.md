I am passionate about games, playing them and building them.
I'm a *Game Developer*, a *PhD student* at [TÃ©cnico](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/) and an AI and Games Researcher at [GAIPS](https://gaips.inesc-id.pt/) and [INESC-ID](https://www.inesc-id.pt/).

My work normally focuses on the development of games and emotional artificial intelligence (the modeling of emotions and their expression). I have a special interest in C++ and the Unreal Engine. I also enjoy studying graphic engines, such as OpenGL.
